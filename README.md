My core skills are in Java and Python, but I'm constantly learning new languages and frameworks to improve my craft. You can learn more about me and my journey in the **About** section of this portfolio.

## Projects

This portfolio includes several personal projects that I've worked on, highlighting my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications. Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects:

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java. This project helped me understand basic logic implementation, user input validation, and game flow.

### 2. Gambling Games

A set of console-based gambling games (e.g., dice rolls and card draws) developed in Java. The focus of this project was learning how to handle randomization, user input, and game mechanics.

### 3. Inventory Management System

A JavaFX desktop application designed for small businesses to manage inventory. It features FIFO stock management, purchase orders, and report generation. This project provided me with hands-on experience in JavaFX, working with databases, and creating a user-friendly interface.
