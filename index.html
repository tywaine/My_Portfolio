    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently attending the University of the West Indies, Mona in Jamaica with a passion for learning.
        My main programming language right now is Java. I am familiar with other languages as well, such as Python which was the first programming language I learned, and javascript.
        I also know some frameworks such as Flask, JavaFX, and Spring Boot.
        I am currently trying to and wish to learn new languages such as C#, C++, Kotlin, Rust, Dart, and many other frameworks like React, tauri, electron, flutter, and so on.</p>

            <h3>Room Inventory Management System</h3>
            <p>
                A JavaFX desktop application developed for Taylor Hall at UWI Mona to digitize and streamline the management of room furniture and occupant records.
                Unlike the existing paper-based system and the current Banner software, this solution supports creating, updating, and deleting occupant records,
                editing furniture details, viewing room data, and generating reports all securely and efficiently.

            <h3>Room Inventory Management System â€“ Spring Boot API</h3>
            <p>
                A standalone RESTFUL API built using Spring Boot to support the Room Inventory Management System's backend services.
                Handles CRUD operations for room data, furniture details, and occupant records via HTTP endpoints.
                Designed with scalability and separation of concerns in mind to work seamlessly with my Room Inventory Management System client services.
